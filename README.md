## Roadmap

- Add a function which logs reverse attempts to the server(Will do soon, function must be Programmer defined so that it works)

- Add cleaner and more readable code.
- Add more useful functions and expand the codebase to a point of utmost efficiency
- Add genuinely anything I think other people and myself will need/want to use.


## Features

- DEV MODE (Certain logs only run for the dev if this is called)
- Succes, Failure, Warning And Instruction Logs, each specially color coded
- Very lightweight and features simple documentation in the headerfile!
- Specific condition control(allows you to select whether misc features such as sending logs to a webhook is wanted.)
- Log a user, IP address, pc hostname, licenseKey(optional), discord name/id(Again optional)
- A unique sub-library i also coded containing a function which returns either Discord username or Discord ID. I have not decided to release the source on it yet because i'm almost sure that its considered malicious. But it is what it is.






## Installation

```bash
Git-Clone this repo and use it through there, or simply install the source code (preferred) and then compile. 
If you have all required libraries. should compile right off the bat. Any issues, Make a issue ticket. I'll try help.
```
